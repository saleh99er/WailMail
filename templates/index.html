			<p>Hi, Welcome to Wail Mail, the web app that plays an audio file if an email
				 that matches a rule arrive. The rules reserve '(', ')', 'and', 'or', and
				 '^'. Every other word separated by a space will be a term checked in your
				  emails. Specifically from, subject, body, and multipart portions of your
				   email. If that word occurence is seen (case insensitive but must be an
				  exact word match), then that word will be substituted with True in your
				 rule, False otherwise. What's located on the right of the `arrow` is 
				 assumed to be your audio file located within static/audio of the machine
				 running this program. Lastly, using python logical operators you can set
				  pseudo-python logical expressions such as the following.  </p>
			
			<p> hello and world -> screaming_sheep.mp3</p>

			<p>Now every time an email arrives with word occurences of 'hello' and 'world',
				the screaming_sheep.mp3 will be played. Note previously arrived emails that
				match this will not trigger this event even if left unread.
